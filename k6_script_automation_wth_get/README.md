Test Plan and Methodology Explanation
Test Purpose
This load test evaluates the performance characteristics of the JSONPlaceholder API under high concurrent load to identify potential bottlenecks and validate system scalability.
Virtual User Behavior
Each virtual user simulates realistic API consumption patterns:

Weighted Endpoint Selection: Posts (100%)
Realistic Headers: Accept encoding, connection keep-alive, proper user agent
Think Time: 1-3 second delays between requests to simulate human behavior
Session Management: Connection reuse enabled for realistic network behavior

Test Duration and Phases

Ramp-up Phase (0-15s): Gradual increase from 0 to 1000 users
Sustained Load Phase (15-45s): Maintain 1000 concurrent users
Ramp-down Phase (45-60s): Gradual decrease to 0 users

Performance Thresholds

Response Time: 95% of requests < 2000ms
Error Rate: < 5% failed requests
Average Response Time: < 1000ms
Custom Failure Rate: < 10%

Critical Metrics

http_req_duration: End-to-end response time including network latency
http_req_failed: Percentage of failed requests (4xx, 5xx errors)
http_reqs: Total request rate (requests per second)
data_received/data_sent: Network throughput measurements

Impact Analysis: Before vs During Load
Expected Performance Impact
Baseline Performance (Single User):

Expected response time: 100-300ms
Status code: 200 OK
Network latency: Minimal
Server resources: Negligible impact

Peak Load Performance (1000 Users):

Expected response time: 500-1500ms (2-5x increase)
Potential status codes: 200 OK, occasional 5xx if overwhelmed
Network latency: Increased due to connection competition
Server resources: CPU and memory under stress

Key Performance Indicators:

Response Time Degradation: 300-500% increase is typical
Throughput Ceiling: Maximum requests/second the API can handle
Error Rate Spike: Should remain under 5% for healthy systems
Resource Saturation: Monitor for 5xx errors indicating server limits

Industry Standard Response Time Recommendations
Google Web Performance Guidelines
According to Google's PageSpeed Insights and Core Web Vitals:

First Contentful Paint (FCP): < 1.8 seconds
Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5 seconds
First Input Delay (FID): < 100 milliseconds

Nielsen Norman Group Usability Standards
Jakob Nielsen's seminal research on response time limits:

0.1 seconds: Perceived as instantaneous
1.0 seconds: User's flow of thought remains uninterrupted
10 seconds: Limit for keeping user's attention

Source: Nielsen, J. (1993). "Response Times: The 3 Important Limits"
Modern Web Application Benchmarks
Current industry standards for API response times:

Excellent: < 200ms
Good: 200-500ms
Acceptable: 500-1000ms
Poor: 1000-2000ms
Unacceptable: > 2000ms

HTTP Status Code Performance Implications

2xx Success: Target response time < 500ms
3xx Redirects: Should complete within 1000ms including redirect chain
4xx Client Errors: Should respond immediately < 100ms
5xx Server Errors: May indicate performance degradation
